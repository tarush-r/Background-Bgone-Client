# 🍕🍍 Firebase + Next JS + TypeScript 🍍🍕

This is a demonstration repository on setting up:

- Next JS
- Firebase
- TypeScript

It displays the result of the question **Does pineapple belong on pizza** by signing in users via GitHub and allowing them to vote publicly.

It uses the [react-firebase-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-firebase-hooks) library to display live updating data of the votes and user collections.

It also implements a **Cloud Function** to create a user document in the user collection whenever a sign-up event is triggered.

Thanks for checking it out!
